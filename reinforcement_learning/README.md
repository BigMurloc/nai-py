# Breakout Reinforcement Learning Agent

This package contains two main python scripts `breakout_evaluation.py` and `breakout_trainer.py`  
`breakout_trainer.py` - trains the data model which is saved under training/model, the RL algorithm of choice is A2C.

`breakout_evaluation.py` - evaluates the trained model, the output is (average_score, standard_deviation)  

There are 4 available trained models in this repository with different amount of timesteps 
[**100k**, **300k**, **600k**, **900k**]

## A2C - 100k
Average score: 7.0  
Standard deviation: 2.79
